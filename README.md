# Titanic_Survival_Analysis

This repository aims to analyse the survival rate, parameters dictating survival and survival patterns of passengers travelling on the famous ship Titanic, using Machine Learning.

# Model Description
Implemented a Logistic Regression model within the project to address a classification problem, specifically predicting passenger survival outcomes. The model's selection was grounded in its aptitude for handling binary outcomes, reflecting the dichotomy of survival or non-survival in this context.

The predictors contributing to passenger survival encompassed socio-economic status, gender, fare expenditure, and cabin class. These factors were pivotal in deciphering the likelihood of a passenger's survival on board.

The logistic regression model underwent a meticulous training process using designated training data. Subsequently, its acquired knowledge was applied to forecast survival outcomes on independent test data, demonstrating the model's generalizability.

All pertinent data utilized in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle, a reputable platform for data science competitions and datasets.
