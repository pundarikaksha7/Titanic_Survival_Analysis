# Titanic_Survival_Analysis

This repository aims to analyse the survival rate, parameters dictating survival and survival patterns of passengers travelling on the famous ship Titanic, using Machine Learning.

# Model Description
Deployed a Logistic Regression model for the project. It was the most accurate fit as it was a classification problem, i.e either the passenger survived or they didn't.

Survival of the passengers depended on their status, their sex, fare paid by them to travel on the ship and their cabin class.

Using these parameters, the logistic regression model was first trained on training data, and later was used to predict whether a passenger survived or not on test data.

All data sources were taken from Kaggle.
